🔍 Log Analysis for Cybersecurity Threat Detection
This project uses structured prompt engineering with GPT-4 to detect potential cybersecurity threats from system log entries. It compares multiple prompt strategies—such as instruction-based, role-based, and few-shot techniques—to identify suspicious activities like brute-force attacks, malware, and data exfiltration.
